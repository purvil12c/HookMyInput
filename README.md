# Hook My Input!

Hook My Input is a **custom React Hook**. It uses the "**useState**" React hook to enable reusability and more composability across form inputs.

No need to create different event handlers for 2 different input fields or **even 10000 different input fields.**

As of now, only the input value and onchange handlers are hooked. More handles coming up in the future versions. 

**Install:** 
npm install --save hookmyinput
